<h1>Local Docker Development DNS</h1>
<p>A systemd service that will monitor your Docker host and provide
DNS names for containers with a <code>VIRTUAL_HOST</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>The domain names will be broadcast using multicast DNS.</p>
<p>A limitation of this is that domains name can only be on the <code>.local</code>
TLD and only have one level below the TLD. A benefit is that you don't
have change your DNS server or configure stuff i <code>/etc/resolv</code> or
similar.</p>
<p>The service will rewrite hostnames in <code>VIRTUAL_HOST</code> to match
this. I.e. <code>my.fancy.site</code> will be rewritten to <code>my-fancy.local</code>.</p>
<p>If the containers also have exposed ports (and the ports can be looked
up in <code>/etc/services</code>) the service will also broadcast the
service/domain for service discovery (i.e. <code>_https._tcp.</code> for
https://my-fancy.local).</p>
